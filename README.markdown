Chart and Graph Library for Android
====================================

<h2>What is this project?</h2>
This is an extension on <a href="https://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView">jjoe64's GraphView</a> (specifically the 3.1.3 version distributed on Gradle) that adds two new classes: AnimatedBarGraphView and LineBarGraph.

These new classes allow the user to have their graphs animated when shown. 


<h2>Features</h2>

Both bar graphs and line graphs will animate the loading of their data. 

<h4>Line Graphs</h4>

Line graphs animate from left to right by default.

<h4>Bar Graphs</h4>

Bar graphs can be animated in two different ways:

<h6>Fill all bars at once</h6>



<h6>Fill the bars one at a time</h6>
